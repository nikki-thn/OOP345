Using COUNT to count the occurence of a particular value:
Ex: int numCount = count(begin(v), end(v), valueToFind) //takes 3 parameters: starting point, ending point, value we want to find 

The difference between v.begin() - member function and begin(v) - nonmember function: begin(v) WORKS with C-type arrays as well. We can also implement out own begin() for a collection without member begin(). Use begin() as a safe habit.

Likely, we will want to count with a condition, not just a value. We can do that with COUNT_IF by using lambda for use in the third parameter:
Ex: int numOdds = count_if (begin(v), end(v), [ ] (auto elem) { return elem % 2 != 0 } ); //to count odds element in a collection
*** sometime we need helper functions to help with count_if third parameter. check sandbox/count_if_class_member.cpp
